[nextPYP](https://nextpyp.app/) is a comprehensive platform for single-particle cryo-EM/ET image analysis developed and maintained by the [Bartesaghi Lab](http://cryoem.cs.duke.edu) at [Duke University](http://www.duke.edu).

Main features
-------------
- Portable, easy-to-use, fully featured web-based GUI
- On-the-fly data pre-processing (single-particle and tomography)
- End-to-end pipeline for high-resolution structure determination (single-particle and tomography)
- 2D/3D particle picking using size-based, geometry-based and neural network-based approaches
- Scalable, small storage footprint (no need to save full size tomograms, sub-volumes, or particle stacks)
- Multi-mode constrained refinement and constrained classification for heterogeneity analysis
- Particle-based CTF refinement, movie frame refinement and self-tuning exposure weighting
- Import/export metadata in .star format to interface with external programs
